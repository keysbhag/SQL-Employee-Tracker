# SQL-Employee-Tracker 


## Description 
The inspiration for this project was to make a command-line application that allows a user to easily manage their workplace database and store valuable information about the company's employees and departments. This allows the user to store values easily by just inputting and choosing prompts, and having the program and database store all the information neatly for them.
